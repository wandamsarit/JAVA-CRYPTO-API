getting 2 Files: EncryptedFile.txt (data-encrypted), EncryptionInfo.txt (for Decrypter)

1-setting keys from keystore by keystore-path keystore-alias keystore-password from input
privateKey: of the owner of the keystore // for Decryption
publicKey: of the keystore that hava entry to this keystore, the trusted-cert owner // for Digital_Signature

2-Decrypt secret key: algorithm = RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
with symmetric-key of encryption from EncryptionInfo.txt 

3-Decrypt data: algorithm = AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
Decrypt the data with the IV-Parameters and with Decrypted-secret-key

4-Encrypt secret-key: algorithm = RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
encrypt the secret-symmetric-key with the alg with public-trusted-keystore-key

5-check- Digital_Signature: algorithm = SHA256withRSA
with digital-signature of encryption from EncryptionInfo.txt 

6-read EncryptionInfo.txt : 
setting from encryption: secret-key-encrypted of the symmetric-key , IV-Parameters of the data-encryption, signature of the original-File


we will get 1 Files: DecryptedFile.txt that will be the same as the plaintext.txt that was encrypted
