getting 1 File: plaintext.txt that we will encrypted

1-setting keys from keystore by keystore-path keystore-alias keystore-password from input
privateKey: of the owner of the keystore // for setting digital-signature
publicKey: of the keystore that hava entry to this keystore, the trusted-cert owner // for encrypt the symmetric key of the encryption of the data

2-Digital_Signature: algorithm = SHA256withRSA
sign the data with privateKey of the keystore, for checking that data was in the place that the keystore is "trusted"

3-create_secret_key: algorithm = AES
for the symmetric-encryption, in size 256 with, random.

4-Encrypt data: algorithm = AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding
encrypt the data with the alg with secret-symmetric-key

5-Encrypt secret-key: algorithm = RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
encrypt the secret-symmetric-key with the alg with public-trusted-keystore-key

6- EncryptionInfo.txt :
create new File that hava data from the encryption that the Decrypter will hava from Decryption part
EncryptionInfo.txt : key - the encryption of the symmetric-key , IV-Parameters of the data-encryption, signature of the original-File


we will get 2 Files: EncryptedFile.txt (data-encrypted), EncryptionInfo.txt (for Decrypter)
